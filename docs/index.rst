Sushi Scouts Docs
===================================

While reading the Sushi Scouts Docs please keep the following key 
design restraints.

1. The application must be easily adaptable to a new FRC game, and throughout the season to meet the strategy teams requirements.
2. The application must be easily used in a competition environment (often bad cell service) by a large number of people
3. The application must be easily used by other teams to increase our ability to collect data

.. note::
   This project is under active development. These docs might be slightly out of date.
   For the most up to date answers please consult our developers at our `website`_.
