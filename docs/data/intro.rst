Intro
=========

The scouting data class's are at the core of the application. All scouting data is stored using these array of classes.
As such they are used throughout the entire application. A majority of the inner workings of the class's is fairly self
explanatory, and as such will be omitted, it is much more important to understand the general concept and meaning of the classes
and how they tie into the application.
